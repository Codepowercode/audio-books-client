    "title": "About us",
    "description": "The idea of Nashir.App came after witnessing firsthand the challenging facing Arabic literature in the Arab world and the huge disconnect between the Arabic literature industry and the customers based in North America and western Europe. We believe in the enlightening power of knowledge and want to create a tool where all of us can contribute to the advancement of the Arabic book publishing industry. \nAudiobook usage is at an all-time high and is nearing the level of printed and e-book consumption, especially with younger audiences.\nArab audiobook industry is rapidly growing, but it remains constrained in its geography and genres. Non-fiction books that tackle serious topics are at the mercy of censorship. Nashir is able to rise above these challenges and allows us all to decide what we listen to. \nNashir.App gives you the power to choose the books you want to elevate and helps us all share the task to bring it to light.\nThe platform splits the income with the authors, creating a new revenue stream for them to help them continue. Traditional publishing has long ceased to play that role for the vast majority of authors in the Arab world.\nOur goal is to revolutionize Arab knowledge production and distribution, create a unique audiobook platform that escapes all the red tapes, and put forward a tool to enrich the Arabic audio library."
